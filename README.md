## Outcome/Learning
I have learnt a lot during the implementation of this project, first of all this project is a medium to large scale commercial project so a lot of planning was involved which I had to do. Then I learnt how the redux works flawlessly in big apps where multiple reducers are required, in this app login, cart functionality, order and payment management all is done with the great redux toolkit, and using redux makes the state management and accessibility within the components very much easy. Also I learnt how to implement the login functionality using JWT token and bcrypt packages which was a bonus point. On the backend I learnt how to plan schema building in mongoDB of these type of commercial projects in which there are many to many relationships, for example a user can have many orders etc, also efficiently managing all this many to many data is what I learnt while building this project.
